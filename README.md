React Rhino is a simple yet powerful state management library for [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Installation 

```bash
# If you use npm:
npm install react-rhino

# Or if you use Yarn:
yarn add react-rhino
```
## Why choose Rhino?

### 🏋️‍♂️ Lightweight
Only **~770** bytes when Minified & Gzipped.

### 🐱‍🏍 Syntax you already know
Offers a straightforward syntax similar to the built-in hooks of React.

### 👷‍♂️ Easy to Extend
Add a new global state with just a single line of code, it's that simple.

### 📐 Easy to Use
Get started with Rhino in a short amount of time.

## Online Playground
[Here](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-rhino-example-svv5b) is a short demo project  to help familiarize with state management using React Rhino.

## Usage

Set up React Rhino in your project using these simple steps

### Step 1
Wrap your app with `RhinoProvider` and pass the initialStates object to it

> Note: `initialStates` is an object in which each entries will  become a global state. In this object key will be the identifier for the state and value will be the initial value of that state.

```jsx
import { RhinoProvider } from 'react-rhino';

const initialStates = {
 dark_mode: true
}

function App() {
  return (
    <RhinoProvider initialStates={initialStates}>
      <Counter />
    </RhinoProvider>
  );
}
```

### Step 2
Consume global state in any of your components, by using the `useRhinoState` hook as in the below example

```jsx
import { useRhinoState } from "react-rhino"

 const DarkModeButton = () => {

 /* "dark_mode" is the key given to the state in initialStates */
 const [isDarkMode, setDarkMode] = useRhinoState("dark_mode"); 

 const toggleDarkMode = () => {
   setDarkMode(currentMode => !currentMode);
 }

 return(
   <p>{ isDarkMode ? "Switch to Light" : "Switch to dark" }</p>
   <button onClick={toggleDarkMode}>Toggle</button>
 );
}

export default DarkModeButton;
```

> Note : `useRhinoState` is similar to the `useState` hook of React. `useRhinoState` will also returns an array containing the state and it's updator function.<br/><br/>
The only difference is that unlike 
`useState` hook we pass the key of the global state to `useRhinoState` hook.


## API / Documentation
### RhinoProvider
Components that use Rhino state need `RhinoProvider` to appear somewhere in the parent tree. A good place to put this is in your root component.

> `RhinoProvider` takes only a single prop, `initialStates`. Each entries in `initialStates` will be converted in to a global state. <br/> <br/>Each key represents a global state and the corresponding values of the keys will become the initial value of the state.

```js
import { RhinoProvider } from "react-rhino";

const initialStates={
   name: "John Doe", // Will become a global state with initial value "John Doe"
   isDarkMode : true, // Will become another global state with initial value true
}

function App() {
  return (
    <RhinoProvider initialStates={initialStates}>
      <SearchBar />
    </RhinoProvider>
  );
}
```

### useRhinoState
Takes key representing the state as argument and returns an array with the state value and the function to update the state.

> This hook is pretty similar to `useState` hook in React.
```jsx
const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useRhinoState("isDarkMode");
/* Here "isDakMode" is the key representing the state */
```

### useRhinoValue
Takes key representing the state as argument and returns only the the state value.
> You can use this if your component only needs to read the state but perform no updates.
```jsx
const darkMode = useRhinoValue("isDarkMode");
/* Here "isDakMode" is the key representing the state */
```

### useSetRhinoState
Takes key representing the state as argument and returns the function to update the state.
> You can use this if your component only needs the updater function and not the state itself.
Having an updater function in the component will not trigger a rerender on the state change.
```jsx
const setDarkMode = useRhinoValue("isDarkMode");
/* Here "isDakMode" is the key representing the state */
```

## Some Examples
### A Component which only read the state and not the updater function
For Components that only read the state values,  declare a constant inside the component and assign the constant to  a call to `useRhinoValue("key_to_identify_state_value")` passing in key as an argument like:

`menu_bar.js`
```jsx
import { useRhinoValue } from "react-rhino"

const Menu = () => {

 /* useRhinoValue only return state value */
 const isDarkMode = useRhinoValue("dark_mode"); 

 return(
   <nav>
    {/* Other nav contents */}
    <p>{`Currently it is ${isDarkMode ? "Dark" : "Light"}`}</p>
   </nav>
 );

 export default Menu;
}
```

### A Component which only accesses the updater function
For a component that only updates the state, import `useSetRhinoState` in the component file that performs update to the global state.

Declare a constant inside the component and assign the constant to a call to `useSetRhinoState("key_to_identify_state_value")` passing in a  key identifying a state value as an argument.

`toggle.js`
> This component will not rerender if the state `isDarkMode` changes as it only uses the updater function and not the state itself.
```jsx
import { useSetRhinoState } from "react-rhino"

const Toggle = () => {

 /* useSetRhinoState only return updater function */
 const setDarkMode = useSetRhinoState("dark_mode");

 const toggleDarkMode = () => {
   setDarkMode(currentMode => !currentMode);
 }

 return <button onClick={toggleDarkMode}>Toggle DarkMode</button>

 export default Toggle;
}
```
### A Component accessing multiple global state values
Accessing multiple state values is pretty straight forward, declare constants to hold different state values and access state values by calling `useRhinoValue("key")` passing a key identifying with a state value as an argument.

`details.js`

```jsx
import { useRhinoValue } from "react-rhino"

const Datails= () => {
  /*  
      Seperate calls to useSetRhinoState return seperate state values
      based on keys that identify with state value.
  */
  const userName = useRhinoValue("name")
  const addressDetails = useRhinoValue("addressDetails")
  return(<div>
      <span>{userName}</span>
  </div>
  )

}
```
